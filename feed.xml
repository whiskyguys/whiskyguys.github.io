&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We reflect on 2017 with a bottle of Lagavulin Feis Ile 2017. This particular Lagavulin was Luke's favorite whisky of 2017. Devin's favorite was the Bruichladdich Octomore 7.3, but we unfortunately did not have that on hand for this video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lagavulin Feis Ile 2017 is double matured in moscatel casks and it is phenominal. It's thick and oily but also well balanced. The moscatel casks give it just a hint of sweetness that nicely complements the peaty smokiness.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Luke &amp; Devin</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Intro to Islay: Laphroaig 10 &amp;amp; Ardbeg 10</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/reviews/2017/12/03/ardbeg-10-laphroaig-10.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Intro to Islay: Laphroaig 10 &amp; Ardbeg 10" /><published>2017-12-03T20:32:56-08:00</published><updated>2017-12-03T20:32:56-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/reviews/2017/12/03/ardbeg-10-laphroaig-10</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/reviews/2017/12/03/ardbeg-10-laphroaig-10.html">&lt;p&gt;Ardbeg 10, Laphroaig 10, two popular entry level Islay whiskies, which one do we prefer? Since Devin is still lost in Europe, Luke makes the decision alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ardbeg 10&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke: Not a fan. The nose is great but it has a very strange chemical taste that is not pleasant. It's too astringent and brings to mind ethanol and cleaning supplies. Maybe this is a bad batch or maybe it's just not my style, but something is off with this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Laphroaig 10&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke: Laphroaig Quarter Cask is one of my favorites, and while this is no quarter cask, it's much more drinkable than the Ardbeg. Very pleasant smokiness with hints of coffee and spice. If you try real hard, you can imagine this is as good as the quarter cask, but if you drink them side by side, the 10 is clearly not as sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to save money, go for the Laphroaig 10. It costs lest and is more approachable. Try the Ardbeg 10 at a bar or at a friends before you invest in a bottle because it is unique. If you have the money, skip both of these and upgrade to Laphroaig Quarter Cask or Ardbeg Uigeadail because they are much better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Luke &amp; Devin</name></author><summary type="html">Ardbeg 10, Laphroaig 10, two popular entry level Islay whiskies, which one do we prefer?

They are very different, but we'll compare them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Nectar D'Or&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glenmorangie's Nectar D'Or is one of our favorite whiskies. It's available at a great price, and it's finish in sauternes casks gives it a fruity and slightly sweet taste. It's not an overpowering sweetness, just a hint of honey. If you have a sweet tooth, you'll probably love this whisky. Even if you don't have a sweet tooth, you probably still like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mortlach 15&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gordon &amp; MacPhail Mortlach 15 is a classic sherry cask whisky. It's aged in first fill and refill sherry casks, and has a full palate with hints of raisins. We really enjoyed this one, it's a great benchmark for quality sherried whisky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these are great, and there's no clear winner or loser here. If you are looking for something a little more sweet, try the Nectar D'Or. If you want to try a classic Speyside sherry cask whisky, go for the Mortlach. You can't go wrong adding one or both to your collection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Luke &amp; Devin</name></author><summary type="html">Glenmorangie Nectar D'Or and Gordon &amp; MacPhail's Mortlach 15 year are two excellent sub $100 whiskies.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Glenfiddich 12&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glenfiddich is a private, family owned distillery. They have 28 stills and sell over a million cases a year, and that's because it's good stuff. The 12 year is very affordable and Luke used to prefer it to the 15 or 18 year. The taste is light and fruity, slightly sweet, a hint of oak, and very approachable for new scotch whisky drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Macallan 12&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Macallan 12 is great because The is part of the name. They are another big whisky producer and owned by the Edrington Group. The Macallan 12 is a little bit more expensive, but it is a little bit fuller bodied than the Glenfiddich 12. You get a lot more flavors and complexity in this one, a little vanilla, a little sweet and spicy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After revisiting these two old favorites, we think the Macallan 12 is the slightly better whisky, which might be why it costs a little bit more. The Glenfiddich is still good, but when compared to the Macallan, it's got a little bit less going on.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Luke &amp; Devin</name></author><summary type="html">When we first started drinking whisky many years ago, we did a blind tasting of all the whisky that we had to see what we liked best.
