&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ardbeg 10&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke: Not a fan. The nose is great but it has a very strange chemical taste that is not pleasant. It's too astringent and brings to mind ethanol and cleaning supplies. Maybe this is a bad batch or maybe it's just not my style, but something is off with this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Laphroaig 10&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke: Laphroaig Quarter Cask is one of my favorites, and while this is no quarter cask, it's much more drinkable than the Ardbeg. Very pleasant smokiness with hints of coffee and spice. If you try real hard, you can imagine this is as good as the quarter cask, but if you drink them side by side, the 10 is clearly not as sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to save money, go for the Laphroaig 10. It costs lest and is more approachable. Try the Ardbeg 10 at a bar or at a friends before you invest in a bottle because it is unique. If you have the money, skip both of these and upgrade to Laphroaig Quarter Cask or Ardbeg Uigeadail because they are much better.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Luke &amp; Devin</name></author><summary type="html">Ardbeg 10, Laphroaig 10, two popular entry level Islay whiskies, which one do we prefer?
