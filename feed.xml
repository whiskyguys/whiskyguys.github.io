&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one took a while to find. St. George releases Baller in limited quantities once a year, and last year my local liquor store got 2 bottles. The owner kept one for himself and the other one went home with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say it's made for highballs, but I prefer it neat. Light and creamy with a hint of plums on the nose. Very smooth for a 3 year old whiskey with a good balance of smoke, sweetness, and spice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever see this for the retail price of $69.99 it's a must buy, but usually it will be two to three times more, which might be a bit too much.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Luke &amp; Devin</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Charbay R5 hop flavored whiskey</title><link href="http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2019/02/24/charbay.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Charbay R5 hop flavored whiskey" /><published>2019-02-24T12:08:00-08:00</published><updated>2019-02-24T12:08:00-08:00</updated><id>http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2019/02/24/charbay</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2019/02/24/charbay.html">&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charbay R5 is distilled from bottle ready Racer 5 IPA. The first time I tried it at a bar I really liked it so I bought a bottle. When I first opened the bottle it tasted a bit off and I didn't like it, but after letting it sit a while I think it's gotten better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet, creamy, and a little hoppy on the nose, rich oaky chocolate flavor with a distant hint of hops&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for something different, give this a try. Probably better to try at a bar before investing in a bottle because it's pretty unique so you might not like it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Luke &amp; Devin</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Sonoma County Distilling Co Sonoma Rye</title><link href="http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/12/16/Sonoma-County-Rye.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sonoma County Distilling Co Sonoma Rye" /><published>2018-12-16T12:08:00-08:00</published><updated>2018-12-16T12:08:00-08:00</updated><id>http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/12/16/Sonoma-County-Rye</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/12/16/Sonoma-County-Rye.html">&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we have Sonoma Rye Whiskey from Sonoma Distilling Co. 49% ABV, 100% rye, double alembic pot distilled, aged in new charred American oak, old wood finished, and unfiltered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually don't like Rye whiskey, and I've tried this before and didn't like it, but this time I thought it was pretty good. I was surprised to find it to be a little bit caramely sweet, with hints of vanilla and spices. Usually I find rye to be a bit too astringent and medicinal but in this case I didn't get that vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had to have a rye whiskey on hand I would make it this one, but if given the choice, I would still prefer a bourbon or scotch over rye. If you do like rye, then by all means give this Sonoma rye a try.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Luke &amp; Devin</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">House Spirits Westward American Single Malt Whiskey</title><link href="http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/12/12/House-Spirits-Westward.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="House Spirits Westward American Single Malt Whiskey" /><published>2018-12-12T12:08:00-08:00</published><updated>2018-12-12T12:08:00-08:00</updated><id>http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/12/12/House-Spirits-Westward</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/12/12/House-Spirits-Westward.html">&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second stop on our journey down the US West coast with House Spirits Westward American Single Malt from Portland, Oregon. Very subtle nose of sweet caramel, vanilla and dry erase marker, a slight bit of initial harshness on the palate followed by warm earthy, chocolate notes and a warming earthy finish. It's alright, but very subdued and lacking complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;45% ABV, made from Pacific Northwest two-row barley, fermented with American ale yeast, non chill-filtered, and aged in new American oak.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Luke &amp; Devin</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Westland American Oak Single Malt Whiskey</title><link href="http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/12/06/Westland-American-Oak-Single-Malt.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Westland American Oak Single Malt Whiskey" /><published>2018-12-06T12:08:00-08:00</published><updated>2018-12-06T12:08:00-08:00</updated><id>http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/12/06/Westland-American-Oak-Single-Malt</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/12/06/Westland-American-Oak-Single-Malt.html">&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite American whiskeys from Washington. Non-chill filtered, no color added, 46% ABV, local Washington Barley, and such an amazingly fruity nose.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Luke &amp; Devin</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Yamazaki Mizunara 18 Review</title><link href="http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/08/07/Yamazaki-Mizunara-18.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Yamazaki Mizunara 18 Review" /><published>2018-08-07T13:08:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-08-07T13:08:00-07:00</updated><id>http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/08/07/Yamazaki-Mizunara-18</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/08/07/Yamazaki-Mizunara-18.html">&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing better than Octomore is more Octomore! We've got a bunch of bottles of the Bruichladdich's 8th edition of Octomore, and we're gonna try the 8.1 and 8.3.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devin doesn't usually drink Bourbon, so I had him try two very good bourbons: Elijah Craig Small Batch Barrel Proof C17 and Colonel E.H. Taylor Small Batch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Colonel E.H. Taylor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This my benchmark for good bourbon. It smells like a good bourbon, and tastes like you would expect a good bourbon to taste. It's bright, fruity, and a little sweet with good multidimensional flavors and very easy to like. I brought it to a family Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. We would recommend not adding any water because it's already so great straight out of the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Elijah Craig Small Batch Barrel Proof C17&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is a little more complicated. At 131 proof, we found it a bit harsh when drinking it neat. However, after adding water, it lost a bit of flavor. It seems to be very difficult to add the correct amount of water to this one, so it just becomes too much of a chore to drink. Given that the price is now inflated from the Whisky Advocate whisky of the year award, we recommend the Colonel E.H. Taylor small batch over the Elijah Craig, at least until the price for the Eljah Craig comes back down.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Luke &amp; Devin</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Nikka Whisky Single Malt Yoichi</title><link href="http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/02/06/Nikka-Single-Malt-Yoichi.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Nikka Whisky Single Malt Yoichi" /><published>2018-02-06T12:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2018-02-06T12:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/02/06/Nikka-Single-Malt-Yoichi</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/02/06/Nikka-Single-Malt-Yoichi.html">&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our friend just returned from Japan with a fancy bottle of Nikka Whisky Single Malt Yoichi so we had to stop by for an impromptu Whisky Time Show shot and edited on my iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Single Malt Yoichi has a bit of a darker character with a little bit of chocolate and a hint of smoke. Supposedly it has a touch of fruit in there as well but I wasn't tasting it that day. I will have to try it again to see if I can find the fruits somewhere. Overall not too bad, but also didn't blow me away. Can't complain when it's free though so big thanks to our friend Takusan for sharing this Nikka whisky with us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Luke &amp; Devin</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Glenfiddich Winter Storm, Glenfarclas 25, Glenmorangie Nectar D’Or</title><link href="http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/01/31/Glenfiddich-Winter-Storm.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Glenfiddich Winter Storm, Glenfarclas 25, Glenmorangie Nectar D'Or" /><published>2018-01-31T12:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2018-01-31T12:00:00-08:00</updated><id>http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/01/31/Glenfiddich-Winter-Storm</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://whiskytimeshow.com/reviews/2018/01/31/Glenfiddich-Winter-Storm.html">&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I make Devin blind taste Glenfiddich Winter Storm, Glenfarclas 25, and our old favorite, Glenmorangie Nectar D'Or. Does the high profile Glenfiddich Winter Storm live up to its high price and exlusivity? Does the Nectar D'Or hold its own against two higher price whiskies? Watch our long video filled with dramatic tasting pauses to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Glenfiddich Winter Storm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devin's verdict: Very fruity and confusing. Hints of wine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke's verdict: It has the complexity and depth of a 21 Glenfiddich with an extra layer of sweet, fruity ice wine taste. It's good but very expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you've tried everything else and need something new, try to track down a bottle of this if you can. If you have a limited budget, get a bottle of Nectar D'Or and Glenfarclas 25 for about the same price as one bottle of Winter Storm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Glenfarclas 25&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devin's verdict: the heaviest of the three in terms of flavor and alcohol kick. Good options for when you're feeling like a more intense whisky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luke's verdict: Very full oaky, dark, flavor with great influences from the oak it's been sitting in for 25 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update from Luke: After trying this a few more times, I don't like it. I think 25 years might be too long for this one. It's very bland, there's not much flavor, just oak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Glenmorangie Nectar D'Or&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still one of our favorites. It's a little lighter and less intense than the other two but that makes it a great every day, go to whisky.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Luke &amp; Devin</name></author><summary type="html"></summary></entry></feed>
